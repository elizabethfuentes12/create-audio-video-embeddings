# Implementation Plan for Video Processing Frontend

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for creating a React application with AWS Amplify that interacts with the existing audio/video processing infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Authentication

### 1. Initialize React Application
- Create React application using create-react-app
- Set up project structure and basic components
- Configure routing with React Router

### 2. Set Up AWS Amplify
- Install and configure AWS Amplify CLI
- Initialize Amplify in the project
- Set up environment variables

### 3. Implement Authentication with Amazon Cognito
- Add authentication resources with Amplify CLI
- Configure user pool with appropriate security settings
- Implement sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out flows
- Add multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Set up password policies and account recovery

## Phase 2: Storage and API Integration

### 4. Configure Storage for Video Files
- Set up S3 storage with Amplify
- Configure appropriate bucket policies and CORS settings
- Implement secure file upload and download functionality
- Add progress tracking for uploads

### 5. Integrate with Backend API
- Configure API Gateway integration with Amplify
- Set up secure API access with IAM authorization
- Create service classes for API communication
- Implement error handling and retry logic

### 6. Connect to Step Functions Workflow
- Create service for Step Functions interaction
- Implement workflow triggering functionality
- Add status monitoring for workflow execution

## Phase 3: User Interface Development

### 7. Create Main Application Components
- Develop navigation and layout components
- Implement responsive design with CSS frameworks
- Create dashboard for user's videos
- Build video upload interface

### 8. Build Search Interface
- Develop search input and filters
- Create results display components
- Implement pagination and sorting
- Add loading states and error handling

### 9. Create Video Player and Results Visualization
- Implement custom video player with timestamp navigation
- Build transcript display component
- Create visualization for search results
- Add frame display for visual search results

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment

### 10. Implement Testing
- Set up unit tests for components
- Create integration tests for API interactions
- Implement end-to-end testing for critical flows

### 11. Optimize Performance
- Analyze and optimize bundle size
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Add caching strategies for API responses
- Optimize image and video loading

### 12. Deploy Application
- Configure CI/CD pipeline with Amplify Console
- Set up production environment
- Implement monitoring and logging
- Create documentation for users

## Security Considerations

Throughout all phases, the following security practices will be implemented:

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Secure token storage and handling
   - Implementation of refresh token flows
   - Protection against common authentication attacks

2. **Data Protection**
   - Client-side encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure transmission of data with HTTPS
   - Input validation and sanitization

3. **Authorization**
   - Fine-grained access control with IAM
   - Principle of least privilege for API calls
   - User-specific resource access

4. **Frontend Security**
   - Protection against XSS attacks
   - Implementation of Content Security Policy
   - Secure handling of environment variables

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time: 6-10 weeks depending on complexity and resources.

## Resources Required

- Frontend Developer with React and AWS Amplify experience
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Access to existing backend infrastructure
- Design assets and UI/UX specifications
